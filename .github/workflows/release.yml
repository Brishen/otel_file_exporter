# GitHub Actions workflow to build the package with `uv` and publish it to PyPI
#
# Uses *trusted publishing* via OIDC – no PyPI API token required.
# The workflow is triggered whenever a GitHub Release is published or
# via the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab.
#
# It builds the wheel + sdist with `uv`, uploads them as a workflow
# artifact and then publishes the same files to PyPI.
